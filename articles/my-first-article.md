Hi there! This is my first blog article!

My blog is finally deployed!

I actually don't want to write a lot of technical articles. Instead, I may talk a lot of bullshit and write tons of nonsense.

BTW, please don't attack the backend... It's poorly coded... If the backend downs, I will be very sad :(

And please, please don't try HTML injection or SQL injection... Or I will curse you!

Oh, please leave a comment below! This is my first blog article after all! Big thanks to commenters!
