## My Feelings About the Video
I am so glad that this video has around 215M views :) I think such a great piece of music should be heard by everyone (Though not everyone loves classical music XD)

## My Feelings About the Music
### Spring Allegro - 1st
This is (probably) the _most most most_ famous part of the whole music. _Everyone should heard this at least one time in his life... This is what music is..._ Without exaggerating, this part definitely gives me a feeling of hope and light. At around [34s](https://youtu.be/GRxofEmo3HA?t=34), the music made animals' sound (at least I think it is). I really appreciate this part. Vivaldi is a genius! He can use strings to produce such a wonderful effect! It is so unbelievable! This song is soooooooo hopeful. Just close your eyes. Let your soul fly straight to the wild and nature. Feel the sound of nature. Imagine. Fantasy. And let hope and light surround you. Do you feel the hope and warmth of Spring? Do you feel the power of Spring?

### Spring Largo - 2nd
This part is not as famous as the first part of Spring. To be honest, I have a feeling of sadness when I was hearing this part. I don't know why. This is Sprint after all! Shouldn't it be hopeful and beautiful? Ha. This music drives me into sleep. Yeah. That's _Spring fatigue_. (That's just my interpretation. I don't think the musician really wants his audience to fall asleep XD)

### Spring Allegro Pastorale - 3rd
Thankfully, this section indeed gave me a feeling of happiness and playfulness. It's very beautiful. Can you feel children are playing games on the playground? Can you feel the grassland that extends towards the horizon? The ending of this part makes me feeling that "Hey children it's time to go home! Stop playing on the playground!" However, even back into the house, the children still can experience the beautiful season through the window. The vivid season ends quietly. And then summer comes.

### Summer
Wow. The opening of the movement directly gives me a feeling of scorching hot. However, at [11m41s](https://youtu.be/GRxofEmo3HA?t=11m41s), the style suddenly changes. **Yeah! This exactly what summer is!** The weather _always_ changes unexpectedly. _Hot as in grill in the morning, rain cats and dogs in the evening._ This part really reflects how weather changes unpredictably and quickly. In slow sections, it reflects how tired people are in summer. In fast and powerful sections, it reflects how terrible the weather is. Ha! That's the power of nature! It can bake you in an oven, or drown you in the showers! It brings things up to space with tornados! It takes things down in the seabed with tsunamis! Are you running out of water? Did you forget your umbrella? Take♂it♂boy!

### Autumn
The opening of this movement is quite different compared with the opening of Summer. This is the season of harvest. Can you feel your warehouses that are filled with crops and foods? Can you feel the colorful leaves on trees? Do you see the golden _Fields of Hopes and Dreams_? The music changes from cheerfully to quietly. This makes me feel sad about the leaves that are going to drop to the ground. For part `Autumn Adagio Molto - 8th` ([26m21s](https://youtu.be/GRxofEmo3HA?t=26m21s)), to be honest, I can't feel anything. I don't know how to interpret this section. This part really makes me fall asleep. So... Frankly... I don't really like this part. However, compared to the previous part, `Autumn Allegro - 9th` has a very different style. This part is faster and happier. Just like... eating candy? (XD) Anyway, this part makes me think about hunters that are catching preys. Children are playing hide-and-seek in the golden forest. Adults are busy harvesting. Everything is so full of hope and happiness. So harmony.

### Winter Allegro Non Molto - 10th
When I first heard this part... I don't even know I have heard this before! Actually I heard this song in osu! Beatmap: [Avalanche by Memme](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/611095) (This is a hard beatmap XD) But that's a remixed version. I don't know the original song is here. Okay back to the topic. This part consists of _quick violin solo_ (That's what I can name this I don't know anything about music -_-), which gives me the feeling of the blizzard and bone-chilling winds. The terrible weather in the winter... This is it. Avalanche... Yeah, this is a good name. I like it. This part exactly gives me the feeling of that. Can you feel the snow is swallowing you?

### Winter Largo - 11th & Winter Allegro - 12th
I put them together because they give me similar feelings. These parts recalled me walking home when heavy snow blocks the traffic. I had to face the extremely-cold wind. The wind just like little worms that crawl into your clothes. No matter how many clothes you wear, they can penetrate into your skin easily. Ah! If you can stay at your warm home, looking out of the window to think how poor the people outside are, that's what you feel when you listen to these parts.

### Ending
Whoa! I've written so much! I was listening as I wrote this "essay". It was 1 AM. But... I don't care. I love this masterpiece. When you are running out of your hope, please listen to this. (Especially the _Spring_ part!) It will definitely fill you with <span style="color:red">DETERMINATION</span>! Huge thanks to Vivaldi, a true genius who brought this magnificent piece to the 21st century.
