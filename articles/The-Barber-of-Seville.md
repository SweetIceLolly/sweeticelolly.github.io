## How did I find this song
When I was listening to a classical music compilation, I found this music somehow familiar.

The music: Gioachino Rossini : The Barber Of Seville - Overture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OloXRhesab0

## Relationship with Tom and Jerry
Yes! Tom and Jerry. When I watched Tom and Jerry when I was a child, I didn't realize that this cartoon put so much classical music into it.

In the Tom and Jerry episode "Kitty Foiled", a snippet of this song is used. [7:01 of this song](https://youtu.be/OloXRhesab0?t=421) is used as the background music in the cartoon to give a feeling of tension. [Go to this part of the cartoon](https://youtu.be/ctD7_vGvs-o?t=145)

After searching the internet, I found that The Barber Of Seville is not a single piece of music - it's an opera.

In another Tom and Jerry episode "The Cat Above and the Mouse Below" (https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6eg8vi), [Figaro's Aria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkMuv0Le3ko) (aka "Largo al factotum") is used.

## The opera
After watching "The Cat Above and the Mouse Below", I became curious about this opera. Today (2020 July 6), I watched the full opera: Rossini - Il barbiere di Siviglia (complet - ST it-eng-fr-de-esp) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSjyDH4MJCc

This is my first time watching a full musical. The famous "Largo al factotum" is at [18:20](https://youtu.be/oSjyDH4MJCc?t=1100). I enjoyed this musical, although some parts make me feel bored. I couldn't understand all, too. But still, I like this opera. I also like the performance style.

The musical is about the love story between Rosina and Lindoro. The relationship between them is not approved by Doctor Bartolo, and Rosina is only allowed very little freedom. `She (Rosina) is allowed very little freedom because Bartolo plans to marry her once she is of age and thus appropriate her not inconsiderable dowry.` (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barber_of_Seville#Act_1). With barber Figaro's help, the lovers finally overcame the difficulties and got together.

This is an image of Figaro the barber from the video, with one of my favorite sentences - `Fortune will not let you down`. Somehow I love this sentence because it's so encouraging. With the English subtitle, I was able to understand the song better. The barber is very confident. The word I want to use to describe him is - optimism. The song is very great!

The play is fun - there are many funny details. For example, "lock the door" ([27:55](https://youtu.be/oSjyDH4MJCc?t=1675)) section makes me feel the doctor Bartholo is a skeptical person - because there are 4 locks on the door!

An image of Bartholo and his servants. He says "I'll be back soon. Open the door to no one". Then, the servants locked the door. We can hear the lock sounded 4 times.

Another funny scene is the suspicion of Bartholo ([1:05:00](https://youtu.be/oSjyDH4MJCc?t=3900)). The intelligent response of Rosina is fun.

Uh... To be honest, the story itself is not too interesting (I fell asleep in the middle XD). However, many details made this opera enjoyable. Also, this is my first time experiencing such a performance style, which is special to me. I like how they can shape characters and tell the story by singing songs. I like the script, too. I think it's well-written. The best part of this musical, in my opinion, is the famous "Largo al factotum". I really like this song. (That makes me think about Tom, too! XD)

This is my experience of watching a musical online. I actually found this genre of opera is enjoyable. Another famous musical is [Cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_(musical)). I may watch it online in the future.
