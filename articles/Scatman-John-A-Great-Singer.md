## How Did I Know Him
On Thursday, 2020 Jun 18, somehow YouTube recommended him when I was listening to other songs.

![My YouTube History](/articles/my-youtube-history.png)

This is the first video that I heard about his name: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyZTblUue4

At first, I didn't really like the recommended song (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop). I actually like the music, but his singing style (later I knew it's called "scat singing") was not my cup of tea. But I still watched that video because I was curious - how the heck can that guy sing so damn fast? And why the hell is he singing like this?

## Then
Of course, I didn't understand the lyrics because he was singing so freaking fast. I looked it up and searched for the original version, which is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy8kmNEo1i8. I heared it for several times to follow the lyrics. Then, I found I actually liked the "Ba-da-ba-da-ba-be bop bop bodda bope" part. I found this song is not so bad. I like it.

After that, I searched for several live version of this song. And I also learned his real name is *John Paul Larkin*.

I really enjoyed these live versions. The reaction of the audience moved me. Why do they so love this singer? Why is he so popular?

## Further
The next live version is the one that trully moved me. It was in an awards ceremony. This singer is very popular in Japan at that time.

Video: "Scatman John Scatman's World & Scatman Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop Grand Prix Award Winner, Japan 1995": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnjwhk4u6uk

The hosts asked Scatman several questions about his songs and himself. When he answered the questions, I noticed he stuttered. How can he sings so fast while he stutters? ([The first question @1:08](https://youtu.be/Vnjwhk4u6uk?t=68))

I liked the second question because this is the question that completely changed my view towards this singer ([The second question @2:21](https://youtu.be/Vnjwhk4u6uk?t=141)). The host asked: `Your lyrics said "If the Scatman can do it, so can you". What is the real meaning behind that?` (@[0:46](https://youtu.be/Hy8kmNEo1i8?t=46) of the song). I also noticed this sentence when I read the lyrics, so I wanted to see what will Scatman answer. His answer really moved me. His answer was: `The real meaning behind that is that we all have problems. Some of our problems are inside, some of them are outside. I am a person who stutters. Because I stutter, I scat sing. Because I scat sing, I'm Scatman. So, my greatest problem has become my greatest asset. Problems outside the people who had the earthquake here I was told, they heard the words of Scatman and they were able to get through the earthquake and I think that's wonderful.` I really loved his attitude. I really loved what he said: `My greatest problem has become my greatest asset.` This is so encouraging. This should be a famous quote. Yes, everyone comes with problems. The good attitude is to accept the problems, appreciate the problems and turn those problems into your power. If you can't get rid of your problems, then find the values of them. The person who knows how to deal with his problems is a great man. "Deal with" here does not mean "get rid of", but "utilize". Also, I really appreciate he used himself as an example to encourage the people who suffered earthquakes.

Now, Scatman's image becomes great in my mind. I want to listen another famous song of him - "Scatman's World": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vDkMEdIkY

This song moved me, as well. The lyrics is very encouraging. It reached a hot topic - **Equality**. This is the topic that has been widely discussed for a long time. My favourite part of the lyrics exactly reflects this topic:

```
I'm calling out from Scatland
I'm calling out from Scatman's world
If you wanna break free you better listen to me
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy

(Source: LyricFind(https://www.lyricfind.com/))
```

He called out for peace and equality. He also told people to "learn how to see in your fantasy". People shouldn't lose their hopes and their determination to strive for betterment. Everytime people meet difficulties, they should see hope.

```
I want to be a human being not a human doing
```

I like this sentence. We all should be human beings instead of human doings. Doing things is not the only reason why people exist on this earth.

```
But listen to me brother, you just keep on walkin' 'cause
You and me and sister ain't got nothin' to hide

Scatman, fat man, black and white and brown man
Tell me 'bout the colour of your soul
If part of your solution isn't ending the pollution
Then I don't want to hear your stories told
I want to welcome you to Scatman's world

(Source: LyricFind(https://www.lyricfind.com/))
```

`Scatman, fat man, black and white and brown man, tell me 'bout the colour of your soul.` This sentence is so powerful that it hits racists so hard. This should be a famous quote. No matter the gender, age, skin color or nationality, everyone in this world should be treated equally. This is the most important message (in my opinion) the singer wants to convey via this song. Scatman is a great man. He is so kind. I deeply fell in love with him.

## Documentary
The following video let me learned more about this great man.

"Scatman John Documentry": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1joxLyd-HA

`When I first recorded that, I was afraid because I stuttered a lot worse than I currently do although that's hard to believe.` ([@0:20](https://youtu.be/K1joxLyd-HA?t=20)) Yes, it is indeed hard to believe that he can sing so fast while he stattered a lot. But he overcame difficulties, and he made it! He was able to control his problem and turn his problem into an asset! This matches `My greatest problem has become my greatest asset`.

Talking about his childhood, he said: `the hardest part for me in my life being a person who statters was my childhood. And about the 6th grade where I was to stand up in front of a classroom and try to recite a current event that was going on at that time. I got up in the classroom broke out tears and cried and went back to my seat. I could not get the first word out.` ([@0:42](https://youtu.be/K1joxLyd-HA?t=42)) Also, he recalled the experience that his friends picked on him and laughed at him. The difficulties that he needed to overcome are far more complicated than I imagine. I feel so bad for his childhood. I think this is one of the reasons why he created the song "Scatmans World". Being unequally treated, he wrote this song in the hope that people with different backgrounds and problems can communicate, study, work, and live equally.

`I took my first drink about the age of 14, and I said, wow, this feels good and I can even kinda like talk better and I can kinda of like even hide from myself. ... I spent the majority of my life hiding out all the way up till I was 45. I hid out in jazz clubs. I could always play the piano and about 1992 I got to hotels in Eurpoe. I could still hide there. I struggled for years as a jazz artist.` ([@2:22](https://youtu.be/K1joxLyd-HA?t=142)) He used alcohol to hide from his real self. He didn't know how to, and he didn't want to face his problem. I felt he was hopeless and very painful. He loved music, but what he could do was just hide himself behind the stage and play the piano. `I was depleted spiritualy (and) physically, had to get help by sought help through an outside group.` ([@3:28](https://youtu.be/K1joxLyd-HA?t=208))

Fortunately, Scatman was able to recover and overcame the difficulties. `As soon I owned my stuttering, it stopped owning me.` ([@3:35](https://youtu.be/K1joxLyd-HA?t=215)) His talent was recognized. He was given the chance to sing on the stage. `I think the one thing I'd like to tell the kids is that you can have a full and complete productive life even though you stuttered. Stuttering has turned from a handicap into an asset. I mean that it's only because Scatman stutters that Scatman is happening.` ([@4:32](https://youtu.be/K1joxLyd-HA?t=272)) He also mentioned his album - "Scatman's World". `I tried to pick certain socia situations. And I tried to offer a way to handle them. And in that way of offering a way to handle it, I offered a way to find peace in yourself.` ([@4:53](https://youtu.be/K1joxLyd-HA?t=293))

## Fame
In 1994, the famous songs "Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop" released. In 1995, "Scatman's World" was released. These two songs pushed his fame to the climax. In 1995, at age 53, Scatman became a worldwide star.

```
Sales of his debut single were slow at first, but they gradually reached number-one in many countries and sold over six million records worldwide. "Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)" charted highly across Europe and Japan and remains his biggest-selling and most well-known song. He later followed up with the song "Scatman's World" entering the UK Singles chart at number 10, which met lesser but still notable success, selling a million copies and charting highly throughout Europe.

## Finale
However, his fame was brief and came late in his life. Compared to the difficulties and problems he met, his fame was too short. He deserved more.

```
In late 1998 Larkin was diagnosed with lung cancer, but he continued his musical work despite being told to take it easy from his substantial workload. In June 1999, Larkin released his fourth and ultimately final album as Scatman John, Take Your Time.

(Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatman_John)
```

Scatman's "Take Your Time" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Your_Time_(Scatman_John_album)) was his final album. At the very end of his life, he told us, and told himself to "take your time". The album was released when Scatman was already at the final stage of lung cancer. One of the purposes of the album, in my opinion, was to thank everyone who supported him and say goodbye to this world.

In "Time (Take Your Time) - Scatman John" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY3O2aGfzhs), the lyrics deeply moved me. (Note that "Time (Take Your Time)" and "Take Your Time" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-EjjW62Yg) are different.)

```
(From Time (Take Your Time) - Scatman John)

Take your time
We can do - we can do - we can do it
```

The repeated "we can do it" emphasized no matter in what situation, keep in mind that "we can do it". Never give up, even though you are running out of time. Six months after the album "Take Your Time"'s release, Scatman John has gone to Scatland.

```
At the concert of November 26, 1999 in Cleveland, Ohio, Larkin collapsed on stage during the show's finale. While engaged in his trademark show-closing scat duel against his drummer, Larkin appeared to faint on stage. The crowd initially believed the collapse to be part of the show, until an announcement was made that the show would be ending due to a medical situation. Larkin was transported to the Cleveland Clinic where he was stabilized. The following week he returned to his home in Los Angeles.

Larkin died at his home in Los Angeles on December 3, 1999, at the age of 57. He was surrounded by his wife Judy, his mother Harriet, and his brother Bill. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea near Malibu, California.
